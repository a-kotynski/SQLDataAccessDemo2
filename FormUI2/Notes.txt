Based on tutorial:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Et2khGnrIqc

I've created my own database and provided its stored procedures based on those
from the database in the video.

This project is supposed to get me accustomed with the usage of the database.
Biggest difficulty: non-programming related troubleshooting i.e. .NET framework
version updates, program template (.NET framework instead of default), 
SQL Server configurations etc.


Ready solution with the database available in the SQLDataAccessDemos.zip file.

Suggestions for the future:
- add to stored procedures clause that makes search easier by adding a wildcard
- make keystroke 'enter' execute search, not insert however to not provide 
an opportunity for mistakes
